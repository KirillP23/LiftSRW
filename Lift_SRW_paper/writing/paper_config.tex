\begin{abstract}
    Exploratory analysis over network data is often limited by our ability to efficiently calculate graph statistics, which can provide a model-free understanding of macroscopic properties of a network.
    %such as the clustering coefficient, algebraic connectivity, and network diameter.
    This work introduces a framework for estimating the graphlet count---the number of occurrences of a small subgraph motif (e.g. a wedge or a triangle) in the network.
	For massive graphs, where accessing the whole graph is not possible, the only viable algorithms are those which act locally by making a limited number of vertex neighborhood queries.
    We introduce a Monte Carlo sampling technique for graphlet counts, called {\em lifting}, which can simultaneously sample all graphlets of size up to $k$ vertices.
    We outline three variants of lifted graphlet counts: the ordered, unordered, and shotgun estimators. 
%	the only option is to have an on-line learning procedure while travelling from vertex to vertex, and gather information about the local structure of the graph.
	We prove that our graphlet count updates are unbiased for the true graphlet count, have low correlation between samples, and have a controlled variance.
	We compare the experimental performance of lifted graphlet counts to the state-of-the art graphlet sampling procedures: Waddling and the pairwise subgraph random walk.
	
%	Extracting data from social networks becomes more and more important because of the wide applicability of such algorithms.
% 	For the large graphs (like Facebook), where the access to the whole graph is not possible, the only option is to have an on-line learning procedure while travelling from vertex to vertex, and gather information about the local structure of the graph.
% 	An important local statistic of a network is graphlet count- the number of occurrences of a small motif (e.g. a wedge or a triangle) in the big network.
	
% 	In this paper, we propose a new Lifting algorithm to construct an estimate of the graphlet count statistic, which has an advantage of having low correlation between samples and being universal for all types of graphlets.
% 	We also propose several modifications for the algorithm: Ordered Lifting, Shotgun Lifting and Unordered Lifting, with each modification being more applicable to a specific goal, making the estimator that much versatile for different problems.
	
% 	We also demonstrate the improvement in accuracy and variation compared to state-of-art algorithms when applied to many different real-world networks.
