# LiftSRW
An algorithm to estimate the motif (or graphlet) counts by "lifting" a graph node to a connected induced subgraph of size k.

The repository includes [the paper](graphlet_lift.pdf) describing the algorithm with theoretical analysis and experiments, 
includes [supplementary material](graphlet_lift_supp.pdf) for theoretical bound of the variation of the estimate,
and includes the Python code used to for experiments.
